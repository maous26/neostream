# ðŸš¨ Quick Fix - SQLITE_FULL Error

## Error
```
Error: database or disk is full (code 13 SQLITE_FULL)
```

## Immediate Fix
```bash
# Clear all app data
adb shell pm clear com.neostream

# Restart app
npx react-native run-android
```

## What Happened
- AsyncStorage (SQLite) storage was full
- Previous failed cache attempts left orphaned data
- Emulator has limited storage space

## Prevention Added
- âœ… Auto-detect SQLITE_FULL errors
- âœ… Auto-clear cache when full
- âœ… Graceful fallback to API
- âœ… Better error handling

## Status
- âœ… Storage cleared
- âœ… App rebuilt with error handling
- âœ… Ready to test

## Useful Commands
```bash
# Check storage
adb shell df -h /data

# Clear app data
adb shell pm clear com.neostream

# Watch logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(SQLITE|Cache)"
```

**App should work normally now!** ðŸŽ‰
