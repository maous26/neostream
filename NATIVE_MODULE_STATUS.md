# Video Playback Redirect Fix - Final Solution

## Problem
The NeoStream IPTV app loads 11,864 channels successfully but videos fail to play with error:
```
ParserException: Input does not start with the #EXTM3U header
```

**Root Cause**: The IPTV server returns HTTP 302 redirects with tokenized URLs, but ExoPlayer/React Native doesn't follow these redirects properly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Native Android Module: URLResolver

Created a custom native module to resolve HTTP redirects before passing URLs to ExoPlayer.

**Files Created:**
- `/android/app/src/main/java/com/neostream/URLResolverModule.kt`
- `/android/app/src/main/java/com/neostream/URLResolverPackage.kt`

**How it works:**
1. Uses OkHttpClient with `followRedirects(false)` to manually capture redirects
2. Extracts the `Location` header containing the tokenized URL
3. Returns the resolved URL to JavaScript
4. ExoPlayer then receives the correct tokenized M3U8 URL

### 2. Updated PlayerScreen.tsx

Modified the player screen to:
1. Check if URLResolver native module is available
2. Use it to resolve URLs before playing
3. Fall back to axios if native module unavailable (though axios also has limitations)

### 3. Configured MainApplication.kt

- Registered URLResolverPackage in the React Native package list
- Configured OkHttpClient globally with redirect following enabled

## Testing Status

**Current Issue**: The native module compiles successfully but isn't being found at runtime.

**Error**: `'Cannot read property 'resolveUrl' of null'`

**Likely Causes:**
1. Module not being properly registered in new React Native architecture
2. Need to check if TurboModules configuration is required
3. Possible need for autolinking configuration

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Add logging to verify module creation
2. ⏳ Rebuild app with logging
3. ⏳ Check logcat for module creation logs
4. ⏳ If module still null, try:
   - Creating a package.json in the module folder for autolinking
   - Using TurboReactPackage instead of ReactPackage
   - Manual verification that package is in the package list

## Alternative Solutions (if native module fails)

### Option A: Use a proxy server
Run a Node.js proxy that resolves redirects and serves the final URLs

### Option B: Switch video player
Try `react-native-vlc-media-player` which might handle redirects better

### Option C: Pre-resolve all URLs
Resolve all channel URLs on app startup and cache them

## Files Modified

```
/android/app/src/main/java/com/neostream/
├── MainApplication.kt (registered URLResolverPackage)
├── URLResolverModule.kt (new - redirect resolver)
└── URLResolverPackage.kt (new - package registration)

/src/screens/
└── PlayerScreen.tsx (updated to use URLResolver or axios fallback)
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Monitor logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(URLResolver|ReactNativeJS)"

# Test native module availability
# In JavaScript:
console.log('URLResolver:', NativeModules.URLResolver)

# Test redirect resolution
curl -I -L "http://apsmarter.net:80/live/..."
```

## Current Build Status
- ✅ Native module compiles without errors
- ✅ Package registered in MainApplication
- ❌ Module not accessible from JavaScript (returns null)
- ⏳ Investigating registration issue
