# üì∫ Channel Logo Integration with iptv-org

## Overview

We've successfully integrated the **iptv-org/database** logos into your NeoStream IPTV app! This provides access to thousands of high-quality channel logos from around the world.

## What Was Added

### 1. **LogoService** (`src/services/LogoService.ts`)
A new service that:
- ‚úÖ Fetches logos from the iptv-org API (`https://iptv-org.github.io/api/logos.json`)
- ‚úÖ Caches logos for 24 hours to improve performance
- ‚úÖ Intelligently matches channel names to logos
- ‚úÖ Prefers high-quality formats (SVG > PNG > WebP > JPEG)
- ‚úÖ Selects optimal logo sizes (closer to 512x512 preferred)

### 2. **Enhanced XtreamCodesService**
Updated to automatically:
- ‚úÖ Try to fetch logos from iptv-org if your Xtream provider doesn't provide them
- ‚úÖ Enrich channel data with high-quality logos
- ‚úÖ Log which channels received iptv-org logos

### 3. **Updated HomeScreen**
Now displays:
- ‚úÖ Channel logos as images (when available)
- ‚úÖ Fallback to emoji icons (when no logo is found)
- ‚úÖ Proper image sizing and styling

## How It Works

1. **Channel Loading**: When you load channels from your Xtream Codes provider
2. **Logo Check**: For each channel without a logo from the provider
3. **API Lookup**: The app searches the iptv-org database by channel name
4. **Smart Matching**: Uses exact match ‚Üí fuzzy match ‚Üí similar names
5. **Best Selection**: Chooses the highest quality logo available
6. **Display**: Shows the logo in the channel list

## Logo Sources

The iptv-org project maintains over **10,000+ channel logos** including:
- üåç International channels from 200+ countries
- üì∫ Major broadcasters (BBC, CNN, ESPN, etc.)
- üé¨ Premium channels (HBO, Netflix, etc.)
- üì° Regional and local channels
- üéµ Music channels
- üì∞ News channels
- ‚öΩ Sports channels

## Logo Quality

Logos are prioritized by:
1. **Format**: SVG (vector) ‚Üí PNG ‚Üí WebP ‚Üí AVIF ‚Üí JPEG
2. **Size**: Closest to 512x512 pixels
3. **Tags**: Supports light/dark variants, official logos, etc.

## Performance

- **Caching**: Logos API response is cached for 24 hours
- **Async Loading**: Logos are fetched asynchronously without blocking the UI
- **Fallback**: If a logo fails to load, the emoji icon is shown

## Example Channels with Logos

Based on the iptv-org database, your channels may have logos for:
- CNN International
- BBC World News
- Al Jazeera
- France 24
- Euronews
- Bloomberg
- And thousands more...

## Testing

You can verify the logo integration by:

1. **Start the app** on your Android TV
2. **Login** with your Xtream Codes credentials
3. **Check the console logs** for messages like:
   ```
   üé® Enriching channels with iptv-org logos...
   ‚ú® Found logo for "BBC World": https://...
   ```

## Manual Testing

Test the API directly:
```bash
curl "https://iptv-org.github.io/api/logos.json" | head -100
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Add logo search by country code
- [ ] Support category-based logo filtering
- [ ] Add option to disable logo fetching
- [ ] Cache individual logos locally
- [ ] Support custom logo URLs from users
