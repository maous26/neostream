# ✅ NeoStream - App Successfully Running!

**Date:** October 22, 2025 @ 3:00 PM  
**Status:** 🎉 **METRO CONNECTED - BUNDLE LOADED - APP ACTIVE**

---

## 🚀 Critical Fix Applied

### Problem Found:
Two conflicting files existed:
- `App.js` (old version, no TypeScript)
- `App.tsx` (new version with TypeScript and navigation fix)

React Native was loading the OLD `App.js` instead of our updated `App.tsx`!

### Solution:
✅ Renamed `App.js` → `App.js.backup`  
✅ Removed empty `LoginScreen.js`  
✅ Forced app to use TypeScript files only  
✅ Restarted Metro bundler

## �� Metro Bundler Output

```

✅ JavaScript logs moved to React Native DevTools
```
